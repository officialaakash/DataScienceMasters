    "It's important to close a file in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Releasing resources: When you open a file, your system reserves resources, such as memory, for that file. Closing the file frees up those resources for other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Preventing data corruption: When you write to a file, the data is not immediately written to the file system. It's stored in a buffer, which is flushed to the file system when the file is closed. If you don't close a file properly, the data in the buffer may not be written to the file, leading to data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Avoiding file lock issues: When you open a file, it's locked for use by the current process. If you don't close the file, other processes may not be able to access it, leading to file lock issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Proper file management: Properly closing files helps ensure that the file system remains in a consistent state. If you don't close a file, the file may remain open, even after the Python process has exited, which can lead to unexpected behavior in other programs that try to access the file.\n",
