    "\n",
    "Training Set: The training set is used to train the machine learning model. The model learns to recognize patterns and relationships within the training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The more diverse and representative the training data is, the better the model's performance is likely to be. The training set is used to adjust the model's parameters so that it can make accurate predictions on the test and validation sets.\n",

The test set is only used once, after the model has been trained, to avoid overfitting.\n",

Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and performs well on the training data but poorly on new data.

The validation set is used during the training process to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and adjust its parameters accordingly.\n",

The training set is used to train the model, the test set is used to evaluate its performance, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting.
